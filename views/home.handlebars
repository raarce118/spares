<!-- ok Chris so I deleted basically every handlebar and started from scratch. Since this will be on the homepage, I called it the homepage handlebar. basically every handlebar needs some kind of reference. in this case, donations comes from the donations model.
Donations-details is its own separate handlebar in the partials folder. Note is for you there. But this was the first step. -->
